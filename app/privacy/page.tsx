          <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
          <p>
            WatchVsWatch (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;our&quot;) operates the website at{' '}
            <strong>watchvswatch.com</strong>. We are an independently run watch photo gallery. For questions about this policy, email{' '}

          <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>
          <p>We collect only what is necessary to operate the platform:</p>

          <h3>Account data</h3>
          <p>
            When you create an account, our authentication provider (Clerk) processes your
            name, email address, and profile image. We do not store passwords directly —
            authentication is handled entirely by Clerk.
          </p>

          <h3>User-generated content</h3>
          <p>
            Photos you upload and captions and descriptions you provide are stored in our
            database along with your display name and the date of submission. Photos are
            stored on Vercel Blob storage. Photo metadata is stored on Upstash Redis.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytics and performance data</h3>
          <p>
            We use Google Analytics 4 and Vercel Analytics to understand how the site is
            used. This includes page views, referral sources, device type, and general
            geographic region. We do not enable Google&apos;s advertising features or share
            analytics data with third parties for advertising purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical data</h3>
          <p>
            Our hosting provider (Vercel) automatically logs IP addresses, browser type,
            and request timestamps as part of standard server operations. These logs are
            retained according to Vercel&apos;s data retention policies.
          </p>

            <li>To understand site usage and improve the platform</li>
            <li>To respond to support inquiries</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            marketing purposes. We do not send marketing emails.
